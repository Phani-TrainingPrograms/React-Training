   - JSX: Syntax extension for JavaScript used with React.
   - Components: Functional and class components.
   - Props and State: Passing data and managing state in components.
   - Component Lifecycle: Lifecycle methods in class components (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`).
   - Hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, etc.
   - Conditional Rendering: Rendering components based on conditions.
   - Lists and Keys: Iterating over lists, key props for uniqueness.

   - React Portals: Rendering children into a DOM node outside the parent component hierarchy.
   - Refs: Directly accessing DOM elements or component instances.
   - Fragments: Avoiding extra wrapping elements.
   - Memoization: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` to optimize performance.

### 6. Forms and Validation
   - Controlled vs Uncontrolled components: Handling user input in forms.
   - Form Libraries: Using libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for managing complex forms and validation.

   - Styled-components: Writing CSS in JS for component-based styling.
   - Sass/SCSS: Preprocessing CSS for advanced features.
   - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework integrated with React.

### 8. Testing
   - Unit Testing: Using Jest or Mocha to write unit tests for components.
   - Integration Testing: Testing component interactions.
   - End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Testing the entire app flow with tools like Cypress or Puppeteer.
   - React Testing Library: Testing React components in a user-centric way.

### 9. Performance Optimization
   - React Profiler: Tool for measuring performance of React applications.
   - Lazy Loading: Dynamically load components to reduce bundle size.
   - Memoization: Optimize rendering performance with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
   - Virtualization: Handling large data sets with libraries like React Window or React Virtualized.

### 10. Deployment & Build
   - Webpack: Module bundler to optimize and bundle React apps.
   - Babel: JavaScript transpiler to use modern JS features in older environments.
   - Create React App (CRA): Toolchain for setting up React projects quickly.
   - Vite: Fast alternative to CRA for modern React projects.
   - CI/CD: Setting up continuous integration and delivery pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
   - Hosting: Deploying React apps on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS.

### 11. Typescript with React (Optional but highly recommended)
   - TypeScript Basics: Interfaces, types, generics.
   - TypeScript in React: Typing props, state, and hooks in React components.

### 12. API Integration
   - RESTful APIs: Fetching data from APIs using `fetch` or `Axios`.
   - GraphQL: Querying data with GraphQL using Apollo Client or Relay.
   - Authentication: Handling authentication with APIs (e.g., JWT, OAuth).

### 13. Web Accessibility
   - ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): Making web apps accessible to all users.
   - Semantic HTML: Ensuring correct use of HTML elements for accessibility.
